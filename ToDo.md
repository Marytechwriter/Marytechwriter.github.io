# Markdown
These are exercise bits from Markdown course. I am using Atom text editor. Not all the Markdown from the course is working or working as expected in this git environment. I have the [Git](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown) booked marked on my to do list.
### Unordered List using asterisks
* Learning '\<html\>' by hand. 
  * Mobile 1st Flex & Float
  * XML
* nano
### Strike Through
Strike through is done with 2 tildes on either side in github flavor markdown.

~~looks like this~~

You can make headings by putting dashes and equals marks on the line below some text.

Dashes
-----
Equals
====
  '''this is code of some sort.
use 3 ticks before and after to make a codeblock. This did not work!! I'm going to have to do the github course on Markdown.
'''html


Inward angle bracket makes a quote block:
>I don't know why the markdown here does not render out as code. A tab should do it or tick.
I am using Git Atom and this is a somewhat different version of markdown.

I can create a horizontal line with asterisks.
************
Oh look there it is above this text.



I can do linking to external websites [TravelBlog](http://maryswanderings.net/)

An inline image ![An Inline Image](dogs.png) is just like a link but has a exclamation point at the beginning.

How about a table?
| Header One     | Header Two     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Item One       | Item Two       |

In Atom I just need to type in the word Table and I get the output above. Cool!
Use colons to align the text.

Making tables is easier to do using [Table Generator](http//:www.tablesgenerator.com)

BableMark is a good place to test any Markdown.
