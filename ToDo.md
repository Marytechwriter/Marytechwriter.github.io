## Markdown
These are exercise bits from Markdown course. I am using Atom text editor. Not all the Markdown is working in this environment.
#### Unordered List using asterisks
* Learning '\<html\>' by hand.

Strike through is done with 2 tildes on either side in github flavor markdown.

~~looks like this~~

You can make heading by putting dashes and equals marks.

use 3 ticks before and after to make a codeblock. This did not work!!

>I don't know why the markdown here does not render out as code. A tab should do it or tick.
I am using Git Atom and this is a somewhat different version of markdown.

I can create a horizontal line with asterisks.

Oh look there it is above this text.

1. list
2. line
3. quit

I can do linking [travelBlog](http://maryswanderings.net/)

An inline image ![An Inline Image](dogs.png) is just like a link but has a exclamation point at the beginning.

How about a table?
| Header One     | Header Two     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Item One       | Item Two       |
In Atom I just need to type in the word Table and I get the output above. Cool!
