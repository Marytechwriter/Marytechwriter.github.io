<body>
<p>I am an Engineer, Technical Writer and Instructional Designer in that order. 

<p>This website is being created by hand using a text editor so it is itself a part of my portfolio. I am using Github for version control. The goal here is to create a page to demonstrate my web development skills and better learn Github, HTML5, CSS, Markdown and XML along with sharing my portfolio. I started this project the last week of March 2019.  Do not expect consistent styling throughout this website since I am having fun using it to try out different methods and commands while taking these courses. Plans for this page are creating a mobile first layout, and a better scheme in general. With the next Branch I am working with mobile 1st development. Flex boxes and @media commands.

    <h2 class="linkdtitle"><a href="story.html"> Storyline & PowerPoint </a></h2>
    <p>I am working on a sample Storyline course here. Check back to see my progress. I am learning storyline and started this on 04/7/2019. I have two months of the trial version to work with. <P>I have a bit of real work Storyline experience working at Boeing which consisted of working within projects started by others. I cannot provide you with real work samples due to NDA considerations.

   <h2 class="linkdtitle"><a href="gsamples.html"> Graphics Samples </a></h2>
   <p> This contains some block diagrams I created in PowerPoint from a schematic from the OEM manual which is shown in the last slide. They also contained animations but I had converted this to PDF for easy emailing. More samples will be added to this page after styling. 
  <p>Note Microsoft Edge does not render this PDF file the same as other browsers. I find it odd since they are in pdf format.

   <h2 class="linkdtitle"><a href="resume.html"> Resume </a></h2>
  <p> I am still working on the styling for this. This will be a 'clickable' resume. Contact me for my most recent CV.

   <h2 class="linkdtitle"><a href="samples.html"> Writing Samples </a></h2>
   <p>The writing sample here boilerplate text on safety considerations that I created for the Ultrasound manuals. Additional writing samples will be added to this page.

    <h2>Markdown</h2>
    <p> I am familiar with basic Markdown. This link shows the <a href="ToDo.md"> Raw Markdown </a>. It does not work in Microsoft Edge but is viewable in Mac products and Chrome. To see the rendered version in Github click here:
