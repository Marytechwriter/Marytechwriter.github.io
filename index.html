<p>I am an Engineer, Technical Writer and Instructional Designer in that order. 

<p>This website is being created by hand using a text editor. The goal here is to create a page to demonstrate my web development skills and better learn HTML5, CSS, Markdown and XML along with sharing my portfolio. It is difficult to share professional work as a technical writer since most companies require an NDA. Do not expect consistent styling throughout this website since I am using it to try out different methods and commands while taking these courses. Plans for this page are creating a mobile first layout, and a better scheme in general. With the next Branch I am working with mobile 1st development. Flex boxes and @media commands.
