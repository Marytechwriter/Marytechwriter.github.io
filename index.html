<p>I am an Engineer, Technical Writer and Instructional Designer in that order. 

<p>This website is being created by hand using a text editor so it is itself a part of my portfolio. I am using Github for version control. The goal here is to create a page to demonstrate my web development skills and better learn Github, HTML5, CSS, Markdown and XML along with sharing my portfolio. I started this project the last week of March 2019.  Do not expect consistent styling throughout this website since I am having fun using it to try out different methods and commands while taking these courses. Plans for this page are creating a mobile first layout, and a better scheme in general.

    <h2 class="linkdtitle"><a href="story.html"> Storyline & PowerPoint </a></h2>
    <p>I started a sample Storyline project called Basic Electronics Course. I have two months of the trial version to work with. I am trying out different features so slide styles may not be consistent.

<div class="short" style="background-color:#c8f8d5">
   <h2 class="linkdtitle"><a href="samples.html"> Writing Samples </a></h2>
   <p>It is difficult to provide real technical writing samples since most professional work is covered under an NDA. Some of these are samples I did for a specific job.

<div class="short" style="background-color:#c8f8d5">
   <h2 class="linkdtitle"><a href="gsamples.html"> Graphics Samples </a></h2>
   <p> This contains some block diagrams and graphics I have created for different projects. Both were done in Power Point but are saved as PDF here so the animations do not function.

  <div class="short" style="background-color:#c8f8d5">
    <h2 class="linkdtitle">
      <a href="certs.html"> Training Course Certificates </a></h2>
  <p> This is a list of courses I have taken recently to brush up on my UNIX command line, web development and various other tool specific skills.

<div class="short" style="background-color:#c8f8d5">
   <h2 class="linkdtitle"><a href="resume.html" target=_blank> Resume </a></h2>
  <p> I am using this to try out different CSS styling features. This will be a 'clickable' resume. Please contact me for my most recent CV.

 <div class="short" style="background-color:#c8f8d5">
    <h2 class="linkdtitle">Markdown</h2>
    <p> I am familiar with basic Markdown. This link shows the <a href="ToDo.md"> Raw Markdown </a>. It does not work in Microsoft Edge but is viewable in Mac products and Chrome. To see the rendered version in Github click here:

    <h2 class="linkdtitle">Blog</h2>
    <p> This will contain a blog.
