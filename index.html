<body>
<p>I am an Engineer, Technical Writer and Instructional Designer in that order. 

<p>This website is being created by hand using a text editor so it is itself a part of my portfolio. I am using Github for version control. The goal here is to create a page to demonstrate my web development skills and better learn Github, HTML5, CSS, Markdown and XML along with sharing my portfolio. I started this project the last week of March 2019.  Do not expect consistent styling throughout this website since I am having fun using it to try out different methods and commands while taking these courses. Plans for this page are creating a mobile first layout, and a better scheme in general. With the next Branch I am working with mobile 1st development. Flex boxes and @media commands.

  <p> This is a list of courses I have taken recently to brush up on my UNIX command line and web development skills.

<div style="background-color:#ddff99">
   <h2 class="linkdtitle"><a href="resume.html"> Resume </a></h2>
  <p> I am still working on the styling for this. This will be a 'clickable' resume with more detail below.

   <h2 class="linkdtitle"><a href="samples.html"> Writing Samples </a></h2>
   <p>The writing sample here is a bit of boilerplate text I created for the Ultrasound manuals. Additional writing samples will be added to this page.

<div style="background-color:#ddff99">
   <h2 class="linkdtitle"><a href="gsamples.html"> Graphics Samples </a></h2>
   <p> This contains some block diagrams I created from a schematic from the OEM manual which is shown in the last slide.

 <div style="background-color:#ddff99">
    <h2 class="linkdtitle"><a href="ToDo.md"> Raw Markdown </a></h2>
    <p> I am familiar with basic Markdown. The link above shows the raw markdown. To see the rendered version in Github click here:

 <div style="background-color:#ddff99">
    <h2 class="linkdtitle"><a href="samples.html"> Storyline & PowerPoint </a></h2>
    <p>Nothing here yet. I plan to choose the best method (player?) of displaying these on an html here. I can provide you with animated learning examples in the mean time.
