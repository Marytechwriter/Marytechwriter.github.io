<h1>Marys Portfolio</h1>
<body>
<p>I am an Engineer Technical Writer and Instructional Designer

<p>This website is being created by hand using a text editor. The goal here is to create a page to demonstrate my web development skills and better learn HTML5, CSS, and XML along with sharing my portfolio. Do not expect consistent styling throughout this website since I am using it to try out different methods and commands while taking these courses. Plans for this page are creating a mobile first layout, and a better scheme in general. 

  <div style="background-color:#ddff99">
  <h2><a href="certs.html"> Training Course Certificates </a><h2>
  <p> List of courses I have taken recently  
</div>

<div style="background-color:#ffffcc">
  <h2><a href="resume.html"> Resume </a><h2>
  <p> This will be a 'clickable' resume with more detail below. I am also considering using XML - not because it is a good use of XML but because it may be the most likely place to try it out. 
</div>
    
<div style="background-color:#ddff99">
    <h2><a href="samples.html"> Writing Samples </a><h2>
      <p>The writing sample here is boilerplate test I created for the manuals for the Ultrasound repair courses I created. 
</div>

      <div style="background-color:#ffffcc">
    <h2><a href="gsamples.html"> Graphics Samples </a><h2>
          <p> This contains some block diagrams I created from a schematic (not my work) which is shown in the last slide.
