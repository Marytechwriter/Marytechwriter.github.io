<body style="background-color:#e6fff5">
<p>I am an Engineer, Technical Writer and Instructional Designer in that order. 

<p>This website is being created by hand using a text editor so it is itself a part of my portfolio. I am using Github for version control. The goal here is to create a page to demonstrate my web development skills and better learn Github, HTML5, CSS, Markdown and XML along with sharing my portfolio.  Do not expect consistent styling throughout this website since I am having fun using it to try out different HTML/CSS styles. 

<p>I have a diverse background and my strengths are electronics, manufacturing and straightforward documentation. I can learn editing tools quickly. It is not rocket science. The answers to most issues are available online if you search with the right question.

  <p> I am using this to try out different CSS styling features. I am using a separate CSS stylesheet for this.  If you are viewing this portfolio on github you probably already have my resume.
