<p>I am an Engineer, Technical Writer and Instructional Designer in that order. 

<p>This website is being created by hand using a text editor so it is itself a part of my portfolio. I am using Github for version control. The goal here is to create a page to demonstrate my web development skills and better learn Github, HTML5, CSS, Markdown and XML along with sharing my portfolio. I started this project the last week of March 2019.  Do not expect consistent styling throughout this website since I am having fun using it to try out different methods and commands while taking these courses. Plans for this page are creating a mobile first layout, and a better scheme in general.

    <h2 class="linkdtitle"><a href="story.html"> Storyline & PowerPoint </a></h2>
    <p>I started a sample Storyline project called Basic Electronics Course on 04/7/2019. I have two months of the trial version to work with. I am trying out different features so slide styles may not be consistent.

   <h2 class="linkdtitle"><a href="resume.html" target=_blank> Resume </a></h2>
  <p> I am using this to try out different CSS styling features. This will be a 'clickable' resume. Please contact me for my most recent CV.

   <h2 class="linkdtitle"><a href="samples.html"> Writing Samples </a></h2>
   <p>The first writing sample here is boilerplate text on safety considerations that I created for the Ultrasound manuals. The second was done for an interview they asked me to write about encoders the day before and bring it in.

    <h2 class="linkdtitle">Markdown</h2>
    <p> I am familiar with basic Markdown. This link shows the <a href="ToDo.md"> Raw Markdown </a>. It does not work in Microsoft Edge but is viewable in Mac products and Chrome. To see the rendered version in Github click here:
