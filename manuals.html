<p> These are screen shots of parts of the OPC manual I worked on 20 years ago at Mentor Graphics. The text and commands appear to be the same however the fonts are a bit different.
I worked with an editor when I started there and followed their style guide. I have since worked with other company style guides and even created one for a project I worked on once.
I also learned to work with UNIX command line, installing beta software on local machines for screen captures etc.
