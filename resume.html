<p>This website is being created by hand using a text editor. The goal here is to create a page to demonstrate my web development skills and better learn HTML5, CSS, and XML along with sharing my portfolio. Do not expect consistent styling throughout this website since I am using it to try out different methods and commands while taking these courses.
