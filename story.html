<p> This is a Storyline Project I started 4/10/2019. I decided to do a basic electronics course for my example. I don't want to present this as a writing sample because I am more focused on trying out all the features available in Storyline rather than making sure I have consistent style etc. Don't be shocked when suddenly there is some voice over. I have it on only three of the slides. I would do it throughout the course if I had time. I put more effort into the quizzing and creating animations.

  <p>Storyline is not the best choice for anything requiring mathmatics. If you want to create equations you have to use Latex or another tool that supports the writing of equations. They do not even have the normal super and subscript capabilities that power point has. So I am creating any needed equations in other tools and taking a screen shot for now. Also they claim that you can import Power Point and the animations will work. I tried it and it did not work so well. It is ok for getting images and text. I recommend copying the Power Point and removing any animations then importing into Storyline and re-adding the animations from Storyline. 
 In spite of all those drawbacks it is rather fun and easy to use.
