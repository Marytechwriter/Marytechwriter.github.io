<p>This is a sample Storyline Project I have been working on. I decided to do a basic electronics course for my example. I don't want to present this as a writing sample because I am more focused on trying out all the features available in Storyline rather than making sure I have consistent style etc. for now. I have voiceover on some slides along with quizzes and other interactive features. 

  <p>Storyline is not the best choice for anything requiring mathmatics. If you want to create equations you have to use Latex or another tool that supports the writing of equations. They do not even have the normal super and subscript capabilities that PowerPoint has. So I am creating any needed equations in other tools and taking a screen shot for now. Also they claim that you can import PowerPoint and the animations will work. I tried it and it did not work so well. It is ok for getting images and text. I recommend copying the Power Point and removing any animations then importing into Storyline and re-adding the animations from Storyline. There are many alternate ways of doing these things anyway using layers and triggers. 
 In spite of all those drawbacks it is rather fun and easy to use.

<p> Since the course is getting rather large I am going to break it down into a separate course for each chapter. </p>
