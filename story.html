<h1> Articulate 360 Story Line Samples </h1>

   <p> This is a Storyline Project I started 4/10/2019. I am not impressed with Storyline. If you want to use any mathmatic you have to use Latex or another tool that supports the writing of equations. They do not even have the normal super and subscript capabilities that power point has. Also they claim that you can import Power Point and the animations will work. I tried it and it did not work so well.
