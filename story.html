<p> This is a Storyline Project I started 4/10/2019. I am not impressed with Storyline. If you want to use any mathmatics you have to use Latex or another tool that supports the writing of equations. They do not even have the normal super and subscript capabilities that power point has. So I am creating any needed equations in other tools and taking a screen shot for now. Also they claim that you can import Power Point and the animations will work. I tried it and it did not work so well. It is ok for getting images and text. I recommend copying the Power Point and removing any animations then importing into Storyline and re-adding the animations from Storyline.
The other thing is if you rearrange the slides the player menu does not update. You have to go into the player to rearrange the menu items. In spite of all those drawbacks it is rather fun and easy to use.
